title: Guess the number
---

Our first game will be very simple: the program picks a random number, and the user must find it. They make propositions, and the program tells them if they are above or below the actual number.

## The building blocks

So, what do we need to code for this game?
- pick a random number
- get an input from the user
- compare the input to the number we picked, and display a message accordingly
- repeat until the user finds the correct number

We will code each of these features one by one, and we will assemble them at the end.

## Picking a random number

Actually this is a bit of an annoying topic in C++, because C++ wants to be very generic and fit every use case. You can read [the lesson on random number generators](../lessons/random) or just copy this function:

```cpp

```
