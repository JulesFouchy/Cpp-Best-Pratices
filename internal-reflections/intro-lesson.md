Buzz words:
- DRY
- responsibilty (SRP)
- Semantics
- Concept
- Dependency
- Composition (there's more to it than *Composition vs Inheritance*. It's also about creating modules that compose well otgether (see Andrei's Alexandrescu's [talk about allocators](https://youtu.be/LIb3L4vKZ7U), or the modules system in CoolLab))
- Change (Easy To Change)
- Intent (express your intent)
- Show intention, not implementation

Explicit those concepts in the first lesson: they will come back all the time to justify why we do things in a certain way.
