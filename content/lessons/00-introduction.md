## Hi ðŸ‘‹

*Welcome to this class!*

We will only assume some beginner-level experience in programming with C++ or a similar language like C#, Java, C, Javascript, Python, *etc.*, and will guide you from your current level to being a solid programmer who loves coding and creates amazing software ðŸ¥³.

## Goals

What are the properties of good code? *Correctness* is certainly number one. And *maintainability* comes second, a.k.a. how easy your code is to change while preserving its correctness. *Performance* comes third, since it doesn't matter how fast you are if you are going in the wrong direction ðŸ˜›.

:::tip GOAL
In this class we will focus on writing **Clean Code**, i.e. code that is **correct** and **maintainable**.
:::

Clean code is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for years. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and â€“ within a reasonable time frame â€“ understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it.

Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between modules and classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class or function).

We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using **meaningful names** and writing **documentation** and **tests**. We will also discover the amazing tools that are available to make our job easier and way more enjoyable.


:::tip It's not about C++
Although this class makes use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any kind of programming project.

## Give me feedback

I tried my best to deliver a great learning experience to you. I am still a novice teacher though (and even if I were experienced, one never runs out of things to learn anyways). So your feedback is more than welcome and I will happily improve my classes with your help!
