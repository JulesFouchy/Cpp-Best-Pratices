## Unit Tests

For example I wrote tests for the code that computes your grades: TODO PUT A LINK

## UnitTesting libraries

There a few out there. I personaly use and recommend [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest). Other popular libraries include [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
