## Brief

Be consistent with the conventions you choose (e.g. camelCase vs snake_case, prefix of member variables etc.)

## Why bother ?

When your brain get used to a convention, you will find easier to read and understand the code. At the opposite, if a project breaks its own convention you will likely stumble on some piece of code which is something you don't really want.

To help you in this task you have [formatting tool](/lessons/formatting-tool) as well as [static analysis](/lessons/static-analysis-and-sanitizers/) which will do most of the job for you.

## Don't be too religious

You might think that the convention you use is the best - everyone does - but it's all about trade-off and no one is right. 

A new project is a great opportunity to give another convention a shot. Don't judge conventions solely on your expectations, because we are so used to the one we use that all the other feel weird at first sight. But by trying a convention for a few weeks your view of it will change. This happened to me with *snake_case*; I used to thing that it was weird and ugly, but now I think this is the most readable convention of them all because the words are clearly separated and it helps a lot, especially with longer names.
