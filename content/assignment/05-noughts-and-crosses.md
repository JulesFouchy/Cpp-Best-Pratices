Today is a big day because for our third game we are leaving the console behind! We will display some actual graphics and the user will be able to click on the window to play!

We are gonna use the [*p6* library](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p6) which makes it very easy. Its API is strongely inspired by [*p5.js*](https://p5js.org/) which you might be familiar with.

TODO PUT A GIF OF THE GAME BEING PLAYED

## Adding the library

First you will need to add the library to your project. This might be a great time to read the lessons on <LessonLink text="CMake" slug="cmake"/> and <LessonLink text="Git submodules" slug="git-submodules"/>.<br/>
Also the examples for the library might help you (in order to find them, browse [the GitHub of the library](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p6)).

## First steps

<TipTryNotToRead/>

In order to get familiar with the library we will start by trying to do some very simple things:

- First create a window
- Then display a square in that window

Again, the library provides all the examples you will need to do that ðŸ˜‰
