Functional programming is an important paradigm that has gotten a lot of attention recently (it took of long after Object Oriented programming). A lot of very good techniques have emerged from this field and have been incorporated in many languages, including C++. `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::transform` and many others are inherited[^1] from Functional Programming.
