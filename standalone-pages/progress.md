## How is my grade calculated?

:::caution
Note that things are not validated forever! If you stop writing good code, you will lose your rainbows! 🌈

### Git and other tools (3 points)

What grants you points:

- ➕ 🌈 Following [the good practices of the Git lesson](/lessons/git#good-practices)
- ➕ 🌈 Having a [.clang-format](/lessons/formatting-tool/) file, and applying it to your codebase
- ➕ ☁️ Having a [.clang-tidy](/lessons/static-analysers/) file, and fixing the problems ot shows you, or asking a teacher what the warning means if you don't understand how to fix it or why it is a problem.
- ➕ ☁️ Having a nice ReadMe, using Markdown
- ➕ ☁️ IDE, debugger, .clang-tidy are very important too, but I can't evaluate them

What loses you points:

- ➖ 😠 Commiting unwanted files like your *build* folder (see [.gitignore](/lessons/git#gitignore))
- ➖ ☁️ Making no commits until near the end of the semester

### Clean Code (8 points)

What grants you points:

- ➕ 🌈 Writing small functions
- ➕ ☁️ Writing small structs
- ➕ ☁️ Writing small classes
- ➕ ☁️ Using free functions when appropriate

What loses you points:

- ➖ Hard to understand or misleading names
- ➖ Duplicated code
- ➖ Overly complicated code
- ➖ Global variables (and singletons are global variables btw!)

### C++ Code Quality (4 points)

What grants you points:

- ➕ 

What loses you points:

- ➖ Headers with unnecessary includes in them/ If something is only needed by the .cpp file, only include it in the .cpp, not the .hpp.
- ➖ Using `new` instead of a stack allocation or a smart pointer
- ➖ Forgetting `#pragma once` in your headers
- ➖ Using `0` and `1` instead of `true` and `false` for your booleans

### Investment (5 points)

Originalité, déviation par rapport au sujet de TPs, ou faire un projet

What grants you points:

- ➕ Asking questions and participating in class
- ➕ Reading lessons (but how do I evaluate that? Probably just say everybody reads levels 1 and 2 and other levels are bonuses)
- ➕ Advancing in the exercises ./ project.

What loses you points:

- ➖ 

## How are the lessons sorted?

They are first sorted by **Level**. Then, for lessons of the same Level, a **Priority** is computed as `0.75 * Benefit + 0.25 * Easiness`, which is then remapped between 100% and 0% according to the Level. **Benefit** measures how much your code or workflow will improve if you learn that lesson, and **Easiness** measures how easy it will be to learn that lesson. The bests lessons are the ones that have a huge impact *and* are easy to learn, and these are the ones that will have the highest Priorities.

## Filters
<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <StudentPicker/>
    <br/>
    <TagsFilter/>
    <Grade top_position="340px"/>
    <br/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>

## Level 1

The basic tools you **must** use while you write code, and the basic habits you should try to start picking up.

<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <ProgressScore level={1}/>
    <LessonsTable level={1}/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>

## Level 2

The essential principles that will naturally lead you to writing better code.

<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <ProgressScore level={2}/>
    <LessonsTable level={2}/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>

## Level 3

Many things that will improve your code: C++ features, design patterns, implementation tricks, more tools, *etc.*

<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <ProgressScore level={3}/>
    <LessonsTable level={3}/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>

## Level 4

Nice to have features, or things to do once you understand most of the things of level 3.

<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <ProgressScore level={4}/>
    <LessonsTable level={4}/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>

## Level 5

When you have nothing important to learn anymore.

<BrowserOnly>{() =>(<span>
    <ProgressScore level={5}/>
    <LessonsTable level={5}/>
</span>)}</BrowserOnly>
