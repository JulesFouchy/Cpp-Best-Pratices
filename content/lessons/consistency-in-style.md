Be consistent with the conventions you choose (e.g. camelCase vs snake_case, prefix of member variables etc.)

But also, you shouldn't be too religious about it and try different conventions. A new project is a great opportunity to give another convention a shot. Don't judge conventions solely on your expectations, because we are so used to the one we use that all the others feel weird at first sight. But by trying a convention for a few weeks, your view of it will change. This happened to me with *snake_case* ; I used to thing it was weird and ugly, but now I thing this is most readable conventions of all because the words are clearly separated and it helps a lot, especially with long names.
