## Prerequisites

Some beginner-level experience in programming, in C++ or a similar language like C, Java, C#, Javascript, ...

## Goals

**The main goal of this class is to teach you how to write clean code**. Clean code means code that is easy to understand, easy to reason about and easy to modify. It is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for decades. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and, within a reasonable time frame, understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it.

Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class).

We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using **meaningful names** and writing **documentation**.

Although the class will make use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any programming project.

We will also revisit some basic C++ constructs like
- classes and structs
- enums
- references (*vs* pointers *vs* copy *vs* move)
- const
- std::vector
- std::unique_ptr
- auto (?)
- operator overloading
- iterators (?)
- algorithms available in the standard library
- lambdas
- std::unordered_map
- templates (?)
- don't forget the virtual destructors !

A focus on performance will sometimes be present when it is really relevant (like : *almost never use linked lists*).

As a bonus for advanced people, we will see the powerful constructs available as of C++ 17 (and even C++ 20) and use them to write great code (and look very cool and snazy :sunglasses:).

## Exercises

- code review (?) (["Did you consider..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta3S8CRN2TM&t=18m12s))
- start a TD from the work of someone else in the previous TD
