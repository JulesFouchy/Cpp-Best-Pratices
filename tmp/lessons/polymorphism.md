## Static Polymorphism

Function overloading and templates.

## Dynamic Polymorphism

Base class *vs* ```std::variant```. When people say why OOP is so great, the biggest (hidden) argument is most often that **polymorphism** is great. But beware the confusion ! OOP is not the only way of achieving polymorphism ; generic programming with ```std::variant``` is an option too.
