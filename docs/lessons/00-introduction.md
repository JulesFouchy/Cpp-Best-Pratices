## Forewords

*Welcome to the best class of your life !*

We will only assume some beginner-level experience in programming with C++ or a similar language like C#, Java, C, Javascript, *etc.*, and will guide you from your current level to being a competent engineer who loves coding and creates amazing software ðŸ¥³.

## Goals

**The main goal of this class is to teach you how to write clean code**. Clean code means code that it is easy to understand, easy to reason about and easy to modify. It is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for years. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and â€“ within a reasonable time frame â€“ understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it.

Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between modules and classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class or function).

We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using **meaningful names** and writing **documentation**. We will also discover the amazing tools available that make our job way easier and enjoyable.

Although this class makes use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any programming project.

## Evaluation

The evaluation is skill based : you will find [a long list of skills](./students) that I deem important, and you will be graded on how much you improve during this semester.

I must acknowledge that you all have vary different levels coming into this class, so I must give everyone the opportunity to make progress at his own pace. This means that the evaluation is not absolute, but relative to your level at the beginning of the semester. This will require a self-evaluation that I will then use to know how much progress you made and reward that.

The extra investment will also be rewarded. I expect that the dedicated classroom hours will be enough for you to get meaningfull value out of this class (and a good grade), but if you want or need to invest more time I will take that into account and reward it.

-> don't spend too much time working outside of the class
-> you will have a great visibility on your current grade, and how it will evolve if you do this or that
