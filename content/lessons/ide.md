An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is like a text editor, but way more powerful! It has a lot of additional functionalities that will help you write, run and debug your code!

I personally use and recommend [*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (*VS Code* for short).

Below are a few of the most important things that an IDE will help you with; I will demonstrate them with *VS Code* but rest assured that any other IDE will have the same functionalities.

## Rename

Right-click on any name and choose `Rename Symbol` (or put your text cursor on a name and use the shortcut `F2`).<br/>
It is better than doing a "Find and Replace", because "Rename Symbol" is content-aware; e.g. if you rename "Point" to something else it will not affect "Point2D" or a comment where you wrote "Point".

## Go to definition

This will take you directly to the definition of the variable / function / class. This is the functionality I use the most to move around my code.

## Find all occurences

## Search for a word in the current file

## Search for a word in the whole project

## Launching the project

## Putting multiple cursors at once
