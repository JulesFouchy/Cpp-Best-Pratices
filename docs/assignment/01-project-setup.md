title: Setting up a project
---

## Git

First things first, let's create **a Git repo**. If you are not used to using Git, read [the associated lesson](../lessons/use-git).

I also created a repo that you will be able to use as a reference / solution as you work on the project. I will regularly link to commits that correspond to the current exercise, and you can also check out the [commit history](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Learn--Cpp-And-Dev-Practices--Project/commits/main).

## Project template

I would recommend you use [this template](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Simple-Cpp-Setup). It is a minimalist C++ project that uses CMake. It also sets up a few tools that will be useful to you. Read its readme to learn how to build it! (NB: I don't recommend to use the dev container for this project because we will do some graphics stuff later on).

[*Here is the commit where I copied the template*](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Learn--Cpp-And-Dev-Practices--Project/tree/35483a5d889d855812f5aefcbef246bb631fe87f).
