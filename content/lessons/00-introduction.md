## Hi ðŸ‘‹

*Welcome to this class!*

We will only assume some beginner-level experience in programming with C++ or a similar language like C#, Java, C, Javascript, *etc.*, and will guide you from your current level to being a solid programmer who loves coding and creates amazing software ðŸ¥³.

## Goals

What are the properties of good code? *Correctness* is certainly number one. And *maintainability* comes second, a.k.a. how easy your code is to change while preserving its correctness. *Performance* comes third, since it doesn't matter how fast you are if you are going in the wrong direction ðŸ˜›.

:::tip GOAL
In this class we will focus on writing **Clean Code**, a.k.a. code that is **correct** and **maintainable**.
:::

Clean code is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for years. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and â€“ within a reasonable time frame â€“ understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it.

Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between modules and classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class or function).

We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using **meaningful names** and writing **documentation** and **tests**. We will also discover the amazing tools that are available to make our job easier and way more enjoyable.


:::tip NOT ALL C++
Although this class makes use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any kind of programming project.

## How to

 **I will not be giving lectures**. Instead I will let you all move along with the lessons and exercises at your own pace. I will be here to answer questions, and occasionally talk to the whole class about very important things that I want to highlight.
 
 I believe this is the best way for you to learn, for practicing is when the actual learning happens. Moreover, giving lectures would imply that you are all at the same point in your learning journey and are all ready to learn the same things, which is definitely never true, not for any single group of students larger than 2.

These lessons are not meant to be read one after the other. Instead look at [the list of lessons](../progress) and pick one (or a few) that seem interesting to you; read the lessons and then try to apply them in your exercises or projects. Once you mastered them, repeat.

 Note that the lessons are sorted by order of importance so it makes sense to somewhat follow the order even though this is not a strict one.

## Evaluation

Check out the [Progress](../progress) section to see how you will be graded, and the [Assignment](../assignment) section to see what you will have to submit.

My hope is that you won't spend too much time working outside of the class if this is not something you wish to do. You will have a great visibility on your current grade as you progress in the semester and you will always have the possibility to submit extra work if you wish to improve it.

## Give me feedback

I tried my best to deliver a great learning experience to you. I am still a novice teacher though (and even if I were experienced, one never runs out of things to learn anyways). So your feedback is more than welcome and I will happily improve my classes with your help!

To do so, feel free to reach out to me directly or [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/issues/new/choose).
