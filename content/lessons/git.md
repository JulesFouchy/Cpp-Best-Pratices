*git* is probably the most important tool of all in your programmer's toolbelt! It is a giant history of all the changes you ever made to your code. It is also very powerful to work with others and get organized.

## Good practices

As soon as you have made meaningful progress and the code compiles, make a commit!

Try to avoid putting *unrelated* changes in the same commit.
