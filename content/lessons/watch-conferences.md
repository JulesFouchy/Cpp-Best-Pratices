This is the best away to improve once you have acquired a solid basis through classes and projects.

The first few conferences you will watch will be hard and you will be lost because you won't know many of the topics that the speaker will refer to. Don't worry and keep going, you will naturally learn those topics one by one as you watch more and more conferences. And not understanding a topic that the speaker refers to should not prevent you from understanding the general idea of the conference.

In the [resources](../../resources#conferences) you will find a list of amazing conferences, sorted by quality and ease of access; so I recommend to start with these, in the order they are listed in.
