## Brief

Be consistent with the conventions you choose (e.g. camelCase vs snake_case, prefix of member variables etc.).

## Why bother?

When your brain gets used to a convention you will find it easier to read and understand the code. On the contrary if a project breaks its own convention all the time it can be confusing.

To help you in this task you have <LessonLink text="formatting tools" slug="formatting-tool"/> and <LessonLink text="static analysers" slug="static-analysis-and-sanitizers"/> which will do most of the job for you.

## Don't be too religious

You might think that the convention you use is the best – everyone does – but it's all about trade-offs and there is no one single right answer. 

A new project is a great opportunity to give another convention a shot. Don't judge conventions solely on your expectations, because we are so used to the one we use that all the other feel weird at first sight. But by trying a convention for a few weeks your view of it will change. This happened to me with *snake_case*; I used to think that it was weird and ugly, but now I think this is the most readable convention of them all because the words are clearly separated and it helps a lot, especially with longer names.
