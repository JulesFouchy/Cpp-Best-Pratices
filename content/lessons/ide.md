An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is like a text editor, but better! It has a lot of additional functionalities that will help you write, run and debug your code!

I personally use and recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (*VS Code* for short).

Here are a few of the most important things that an IDE will help you with; I will demonstrate them *VS Code* but rest assured that any IDE will have the same functionalities.

## Go to definition

## Find all occurences

## Search for a word in the current file

## Search for a word in the whole project

## Launching the project

## Rename

## Putting multiple cursors at once
