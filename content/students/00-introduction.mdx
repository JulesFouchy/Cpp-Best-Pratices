Welcome! In this section you will be able to see your progress live, your current grade, and the next skills that you can learn. Each student has their own page which I will update regularly with the skills that I have validated.

Checked in grey are the skills you already had before this semester, in green the ones I validated during this semester, and in blue the ones that you can temporarily check to see what your grade would be if you were to validate those skills.

## How are the skills sorted ?

They are first sorted by **Order**, which is a rough measure of a logical order that the lessons should be learned in. For example you can't learn about *Git submodules* if you don't even know what *Git* is yet.

Then, for skills of the same Order, a **Priority** is computed as `0.75 * Benefit + 0.25 * Easiness`, which is then remapped between 100% and 0% according to the Order. **Benefit** measures how much your code or workflow will improve if you learn that skill, and **Easiness** measures how easy it will be to learn that skill. The bests skills are the ones that have a huge impact *and* are easy to learn, and this is the ones that will have the highest Priorities.

## How is my grade calculated ?

Each mastered skill gives you some points based on how long it should have taken you to learn. We sum all these points, and then apply [a compression function](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6gmdt6tfmf) to map this score between 0 and 20. You can see the exact source code that I use [here](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Thoughts-on-Teaching/blob/c6947daed205fe12c865667e8f42a801df46e226/evaluation/grader.js).

## Self-evaluation

Please tick the skills that you consider to master already, then export them as json using that big green button and send them to me.

If you have a doubt, don't tick the skill ; in the worst case this will mean that you will have a skill that is easy to validate during the semester.

You don't need to check skills of order 3 or higher if you can't be bothered reading the whole list (which is arguably pretty long).
