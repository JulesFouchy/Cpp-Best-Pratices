Implement a Shape hierarchy with inheritance, and then std::variant.

We want to be able to have a ```std::vector<Shape>``` and easily iterate over it to draw all the shapes.

Then benchmark to compare the two implementations. (+ think about which one is the nicest to use and to extend (which one follows *Open-Closed* the best ?))
