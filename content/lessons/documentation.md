## Document for users

## Document for developers

State your intentions, the alternatives you considered, the reason that made you choose this particular implementation etc. Don't be shy, talk a lot, leave a trace for others.

Even if you are unsure or not confident about your design, say it ! It will help future developers have no remorse to rewrite your code, and be confident there isn't some important thing that they are missing and that made you write the code this way.
