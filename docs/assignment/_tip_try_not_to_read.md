I encourage you to first try to code without reading the guided steps that follow! Think of the different functions that you need to write, and try to implement them!<br/>
Only when you are stuck are you allowed to keep reading 😉 And read only enough to get unstuck! Then try to keep coding by yourself 😁 (until you are stuck again)
