- Do only a project, tell them to just get something to work in the first half of the semester, and then clean it up in the second half?

- Most people finish hangman at around 2/3 of the semester

- Should I add the special rule that you must always commit at the end of a class session? (on a "WIP" branch?) This is not necessarily a good guideline in general but this allows me to track their progress.

- Fact: when you give many lessons to people and tell them to read them over time when they are ready, most people will actually read them all in one go. Is this a bad thing?
