## Goals

:::tip GOAL
In this class we will focus on writing **Clean Code**, i.e. code that is **correct** and **maintainable**.
:::

Clean code is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for years. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and – within a reasonable time frame – understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it.

Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between modules and classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class or function).

We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using **meaningful names** and writing **documentation** and **tests**. We will also discover the amazing tools that are available to make our job easier and way more enjoyable.


:::tip It's not about C++
Although this class makes use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any kind of programming project.
