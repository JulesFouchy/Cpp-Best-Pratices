# The *Good or Bad Software* game

One at a time, people give a software name, then everybody votes whether they think it's good or bad software. We write the result down. Then the person that gave the software can give it's opinion and give positive and / or negative aspects of the soft. Then everybody can discuss further.

At the end, we can try to find common points between the good softwares and between the bad ones. e.g. : Open Source, Recent, Based on web technologies / based on Qt,
