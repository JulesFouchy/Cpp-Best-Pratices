There are a lot of bugs and bad coding habits that can be caught by tools. It can really help you a lot to improve the quality of your code!

If you use [this C++ template project](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Simple-Cpp-Setup) you will get a lot of tools installed out of the box. If not, consider using some VS Code extensions: [jbenden.c-cpp-flylint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbenden.c-cpp-flylint) and [notskm.clang-tidy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=notskm.clang-tidy) ; note that you will also have to install the tools that these extension rely one (CppCheck, clang-tidy and so on).
