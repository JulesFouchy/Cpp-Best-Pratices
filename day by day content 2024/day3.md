[Refactoring exercise](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Refactoring-Exercises)

The trivia game, part 2: find bad code structure, duplicated code, missing helper functions / classes, functions that are too long, code that will break when changes happen (e.g. when we want to add a new category, or add more attributes to players). Refactor as much as possible.
