If you finished all the tutorials and still want to keep coding, now is a good time to decide by yourself what you want to add next to your project 😁<br/>
AIs for the other games? More games? Highscores and stats for the games? It is up to you!<br/>
You could also come back to the code you have already written and try to improve it. Or just read lessons until you learn something new that you could apply to the code you have.

There won't be any guided steps, but you can discuss with me at any time 😁
